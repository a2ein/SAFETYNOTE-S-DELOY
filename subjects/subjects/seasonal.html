        <h2>Cure</h2>
        <p>There is no cure for the flu, but antiviral drugs can help reduce the severity and duration of symptoms if taken early. These medications are most effective when started within two days of symptom onset. Common antiviral drugs include oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). Rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications to relieve symptoms can also help.</p>
